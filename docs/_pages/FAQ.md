Q: *What is the goal of this project?*
A: To provide an open source, affordable VR eyetracker for VR Chat and more.

Q: *What headsets will be supported?*
A: Any headset that the hardware can fit in with community mounts or a mount you design. 

Q: *How will this work?*
A: Currently, a camera is mounted inside the headset for each eye. The camera streams through wifi to a PC client which processes and sends eye tracking data to VR Chat. 

Q: *What features will be supported?* 
A: The goal is eye tracking with eye openess, and some form of pupil dilation.  A far away aspiration of this project is some form of weak foveated rendering because it's cool and any small performance increase in VR is welcome.

Q: *When will this be completed?* 
A: When it's done ;) I have a semi busy life so development may slow and speed up inconsistently. I have a goal to be done with all base features in June.

Q: *How expensive will this be?* 
A: My goal is to keep it as cheap as possible with around $75 as the absolute max, with current projections being around $25-40.

Q: *Will IR damage my eyes?*
A: This project has safety in mind. If you do all of the safety measure we put in place and visually test the amount of IR light you will be fine. Please note we have not finished development of all safety stuff so be careful https://dammedia.osram.info/media/bin/osram-dam-2496608/AN002_Details%20on%20photobiological%20safety%20of%20LED%20light%20sources.pdf 

Q: *What hardware does this use?/How do I build?* 
A: Testing is still being done to validate our current hardware choice, no hardware has been fully confirmed therefore I cannot recommend you buy parts and assemble one yourself unless you are good with losing money and are going to be actively contributing to the project. This stands true still as of 5/3

Q: *Where's the docs?*
A: All of our documentation is located here https://redhawk989.github.io/EyeTrackVR/ all future documentation will be found there as well.

Q: *How do I set up my avatar?*
A: Check out the VR Chat face tracking wiki. https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/wiki keep in mind that we currently only support float paramaters.
