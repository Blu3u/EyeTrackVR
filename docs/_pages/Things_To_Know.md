## This page will be an overview of things to know and understand before you start this project.

### Hardware is not final.
Our hardware may change at any time, make sure you are okay with having to buy more parts.

### Software is not final. 
There are bound to be function-breaking errors and bugs that have not been figured out.

### Firmware is not complete.
Our firmware has not been 100% completed and tested widely, expect issues.

### IR emitters are dangerous.
If handled wrong or precautions are ignored you can and will cause damage to your eyes. Please make sure to only buy linked ones or ones with specs that match exactly. We will not be responsible for damaged caused if you go your own route.

### Documentation is not complete.
Do not expect a clear build guide.

### You will need to set up your avatar to use this.
This will require some basic Unity knowledge and owning your own avatar.
