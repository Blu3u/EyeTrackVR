## This page will include a basic part list for building an EyeTrackVR setup.

### Please note that no hardware has been fully set in stone, all purchases are at your loss if hardware changes.


It is recommended to source parts from AliExpress as it is much cheaper


## Wireless setup:

2x ESP-CAM-32 modules [AliExpress here](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mKjL9Cq)

2x ov2640 160Â° fov IR / Night vers 75mm (850nm) [AliExpress here](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mrNbZww)

1x ESP-CAM programmer/ MB [AliExpress here](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mPaPgPu)

All three of the above can be found in a kit from [AliExpress here](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNSRfUe) make sure to get 2 of the 75mm-160- 850nm version.
 
1x USB type-A male port to power both ESPs
[AliExpress here](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mOCRTcq)

1x Lower gauge wire to power ESPs
[28 gauge wire from AliExpress here](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mK72cy6)



## Wired setup

2x Wired Ov5640 160 deg cameras [AliExpress here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2255799933896897.html)

**Please note: if the wired option is used, you will need to dissasemble the camera to remove the ir filters.**
**I would reccomend getting extra cameras, either the full thing above or just the camera [from AliExpress here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256803544318475.html)**

1x USB type-A male port to power both IR emmitters
[AliExpress here](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mOCRTcq)



## IR Emitters

4x Unfocused SMD IR emitters 
Recommend ones [from Digikey here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/inolux/IN-P32ZTIR/10384796) (DO NOT BUY FOCUSED ONES! If they look like something you would find in a TV remote do not use them, if you aren't sure exactly what you are doing, buy them from the Digikey link)

4x IR emitter PCB's (highly recommended) 

2x 698-710ohm resistors or the more recommend way, 4x 350ohm 1206 SMD resistors for IR emitters (If you are not using PCB's for the emitters then buying regular through-hole resistors is acceptable)
[357 ohm from Digikey here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stackpole-electronics-inc/RMCF1206FT357R/1759919) or
[698 ohm from LCSC here](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Chip-Resistor-Surface-Mount_FOJAN-FRC1206F6980TS_C2933749.html)

1x Wire to power IR emitters
[32 gauge wire from AliExpress here](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mK72cy6)



## Other parts

1x Hot glue or another form of glue

1x Soldering iron and solder (lead free solder highly recommended)

## 3d Printed Parts

### Other Headsets

If you own another headset not listed above, that means there are no mounts designed for them yet. If you have basic skills in modeling or think up a solution to mount cams and emitters, please try to make a mount and then let us in the discord know so it can be added here. Any headset that can fit the camera is potentially compatible. If you are willing, give it a shot to design a mount for the rest of the community.
