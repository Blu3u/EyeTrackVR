## This page will compare the differences between a wireless setup verses a wired one.

{% include custom/alerts/Note.html content="Things may change so this is only true with the current hardware as of 6/20/22." %}

## Wired:

### Pros:

- Plug and play, no firmware or wifi router needed

- Lowest latency
{% include custom/alerts/Note.html content="Our latency with wireless setups is pretty low, (20-35ms) you will not be able to see a difference in social VR applications. This would only become a noticable change if we ever get DFR working." %}

- Higher resolution
{% include custom/alerts/Note.html content="Higher resolution does not result in a measurable tracking quality change although it can help." %}

### Cons:

- More expensive at around twice the cost of wireless

- Requires 2 usb ports and usb bandwith, wireless uses 1 port for only power.

- Camera disassembly is required to remove the IR filter

- USB bus issues

{% include custom/alerts/Warning.html content="Due to USB issues, only 1 camera per headset is supported unless you have 2 seperate USB ports to plug in to. USB hubs WILL NOT WORK." %}

## Wireless

### Pros:

- Cheapest

- Wireless

- Only requires 1 usb for power

- Cameras do not need to be disassembled (for 160 fov)

### Cons:

- Requires a WiFi network on 2.4GHz 

- Flashing firmware is needed

- Higer latency
