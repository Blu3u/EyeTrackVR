# How to set up your avatar for eye tracking:

Currently, the best resource is the VRC Face Tracking GitHub and Discord [https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/wiki/Eye-Tracking-Setup](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/wiki/Eye-Tracking-Setup) and [https://discord.gg/Fh4FNehzKn](https://discord.gg/Fh4FNehzKn) respectfully.

I hope to have a good video available from a community member that shows and explains the process eventually.
