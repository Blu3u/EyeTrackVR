<!-- 
    The include uses markdown="span" as an attribute, which means kramdown will process the entire content as a span. 
    You canâ€™t use block elements such as p or div or pre. 
    If you need these elements, you can either manually surround the content with the HTML from the include, 
    or you can use the example in the alerts_alternative.yml file.

    An example of how to use these: 
        {% include note.html content="This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph." %}
        {% include warning.html content="This is my warning. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph." %}
        {% include important.html content="This is my important. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph." %}
        {% include callout.html type="info" content="This is my callout. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph." %}

    Example of writing on multiple lines: 

        {% include note.html content="This is my note. All the content I type here is treated as a single paragraph. <br/><br/> Now I'm typing on a  new line." %}
 -->
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b>
    {{include.content}}</div>
