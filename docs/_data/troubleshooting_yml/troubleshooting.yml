- question: "My ESP32-Cam wont connect in PlatformIO"
  answer: "First, make sure you are using a cable that can transmit data. Then check if your programmer board has a button labled IOO. If it does, hold that button in while plugging the tracker in. If both of those things don't work, try a system restart."
